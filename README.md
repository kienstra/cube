# Cube

An Orchestrator, copied from [Build an Orchestrator in Go](https://www.manning.com/books/build-an-orchestrator-in-go-from-scratch).

A basic system, like Kubernetes.

The purpose is to learn how Kubernetes works, not improve upon it.

Here's the [official book repo](https://github.com/buildorchestratoringo/code).
